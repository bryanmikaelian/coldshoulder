# Coldshoulder

Generate those gitignore files with ease.

## Installation

    $ gem install coldshoulder

## Usage

In the root of the directory, enter the following command:

    coldshoulder generate [Language name]

Boom.  You now have a gitignore file generated from the templates that GitHub uses.  Easy huh?

Note:  You have to specify the exact name of the file in the following repo https://github.com/github/gitignore .  This will be fixed in a future release.
